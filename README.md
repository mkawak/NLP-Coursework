# NLP Coursework - UCR

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework from the Natural Language Processing course at the University of California, Riverside (CS173). The assignments cover various aspects of dataset creation, text classification, emotion classification, and exploration of word embeddings.

## Projects and Learning Outcomes

### 1. Dataset Creation / 2. NRC Emotional Lexicon
- Developed skills in building datasets for text classification.
- Gained experience in composing sentences for emotion detection and sentiment analysis.

### 3. Emotion Classification with Naïve Bayes
- Explored Naïve Bayes algorithms for classifying emotions in text.
- Applied statistical models to differentiate emotional contexts.

### 4. Logistic Regression for Emotion Classification
- Used logistic regression for emotion classification in text.
- Focused on feature extraction and model tuning.

### 5. Word2Vec Embeddings
- Investigated Word2Vec embeddings for emotion-based text analysis.
- Learned about generating and applying word embeddings in sentiment analysis.

### 6. Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
- Employing attention mechanisms to enhance memory and accuracy.
- Analyzing the model's effectiveness and identifying improvement areas.

## Skills Acquired
- Proficient in text preprocessing and data normalization techniques.
- Skilled in implementing and optimizing various machine learning models for NLP tasks.
- Deep understanding of word embeddings and their role in sentiment analysis.
